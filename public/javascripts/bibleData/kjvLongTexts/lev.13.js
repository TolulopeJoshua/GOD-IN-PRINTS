then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests: <span data-number=\"3\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:3\" class=\"v\">3</span>And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and <span class=\"add\">when</span> the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight <span class=\"add\">be</span> deeper than the skin of his flesh, it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. <span data-number=\"4\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:4\" class=\"v\">4</span>If the bright spot <span class=\"add\">be</span> white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight <span class=\"add\">be</span> not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up <span class=\"add\">him that hath</span> the plague seven days: <span data-number=\"5\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:5\" class=\"v\">5</span>And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, <span class=\"add\">if</span> the plague in his sight be at a stay, <span class=\"add\">and</span> the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more: <span data-number=\"6\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:6\" class=\"v\">6</span>And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, <span class=\"add\">if</span> the plague <span class=\"add\">be</span> somewhat dark, <span class=\"add\">and</span> the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it <span class=\"add\">is but</span> a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. <span data-number=\"7\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:7\" class=\"v\">7</span>But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again: <span data-number=\"8\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:8\" class=\"v\">8</span>And <span class=\"add\">if</span> the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a leprosy.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"9\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:9\" class=\"v\">9</span>¶ When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest; <span data-number=\"10\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:10\" class=\"v\">10</span>And the priest shall see <span class=\"add\">him:</span> and, behold, <span class=\"add\">if</span> the rising <span class=\"add\">be</span> white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and <span class=\"add\">there be</span> quick raw flesh in the rising; <span data-number=\"11\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:11\" class=\"v\">11</span>It <span class=\"add\">is</span> an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he <span class=\"add\">is</span> unclean. <span data-number=\"12\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:12\" class=\"v\">12</span>And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of <span class=\"add\">him that hath</span> the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; <span data-number=\"13\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:13\" class=\"v\">13</span>Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, <span class=\"add\">if</span> the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce <span class=\"add\">him</span> clean <span class=\"add\">that hath</span> the plague: it is all turned white: he <span class=\"add\">is</span> clean. <span data-number=\"14\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:14\" class=\"v\">14</span>But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. <span data-number=\"15\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:15\" class=\"v\">15</span>And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: <span class=\"add\">for</span> the raw flesh <span class=\"add\">is</span> unclean: it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a leprosy. <span data-number=\"16\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:16\" class=\"v\">16</span>Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest; <span data-number=\"17\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:17\" class=\"v\">17</span>And the priest shall see him: and, behold, <span class=\"add\">if</span> the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce <span class=\"add\">him</span> clean <span class=\"add\">that hath</span> the plague: he <span class=\"add\">is</span> clean.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"18\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:18\" class=\"v\">18</span>¶ The flesh also, in which, <span class=\"add\">even</span> in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed, <span data-number=\"19\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:19\" class=\"v\">19</span>And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest; <span data-number=\"20\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:20\" class=\"v\">20</span>And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it <span class=\"add\">be</span> in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil. <span data-number=\"21\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:21\" class=\"v\">21</span>But if the priest look on it, and, behold, <span class=\"add\">there be</span> no white hairs therein, and <span class=\"add\">if</span> it <span class=\"add\">be</span> not lower than the skin, but <span class=\"add\">be</span> somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: <span data-number=\"22\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:22\" class=\"v\">22</span>And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a plague. <span data-number=\"23\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:23\" class=\"v\">23</span>But if the bright spot stay in his place, <span class=\"add\">and</span> spread not, it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"24\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:24\" class=\"v\">24</span>¶ Or if there be <span class=\"add\">any</span> flesh, in the skin whereof <span class=\"add\">there is</span> a hot burning, and the quick <span class=\"add\">flesh</span> that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white; <span data-number=\"25\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:25\" class=\"v\">25</span>Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, <span class=\"add\">if</span> the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it <span class=\"add\">be in</span> sight deeper than the skin; it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <span class=\"add\">is</span> the plague of leprosy. <span data-number=\"26\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:26\" class=\"v\">26</span>But if the priest look on it, and, behold, <span class=\"add\">there be</span> no white hair in the bright spot, and it <span class=\"add\">be</span> no lower than the <span class=\"add\">other</span> skin, but <span class=\"add\">be</span> somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: <span data-number=\"27\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:27\" class=\"v\">27</span>And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: <span class=\"add\">and</span> if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <span class=\"add\">is</span> the plague of leprosy. <span data-number=\"28\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:28\" class=\"v\">28</span>And if the bright spot stay in his place, <span class=\"add\">and</span> spread not in the skin, but it <span class=\"add\">be</span> somewhat dark; it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it <span class=\"add\">is</span> an inflammation of the burning.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"29\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:29\" class=\"v\">29</span>¶ If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard; <span data-number=\"30\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:30\" class=\"v\">30</span>Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it <span class=\"add\">be</span> in sight deeper than the skin; <span class=\"add\">and there be</span> in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a dry scall, <span class=\"add\">even</span> a leprosy upon the head or beard. <span data-number=\"31\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:31\" class=\"v\">31</span>And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it <span class=\"add\">be</span> not in sight deeper than the skin, and <span class=\"add\">that there is</span> no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up <span class=\"add\">him that hath</span> the plague of the scall seven days: <span data-number=\"32\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:32\" class=\"v\">32</span>And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, <span class=\"add\">if</span> the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall <span class=\"add\">be</span> not in sight deeper than the skin; <span data-number=\"33\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:33\" class=\"v\">33</span>He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up <span class=\"add\">him that hath</span> the scall seven days more: <span data-number=\"34\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:34\" class=\"v\">34</span>And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, <span class=\"add\">if</span> the scall be not spread in the skin, nor <span class=\"add\">be</span> in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. <span data-number=\"35\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:35\" class=\"v\">35</span>But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing; <span data-number=\"36\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:36\" class=\"v\">36</span>Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he <span class=\"add\">is</span> unclean. <span data-number=\"37\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:37\" class=\"v\">37</span>But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and <span class=\"add\">that</span> there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he <span class=\"add\">is</span> clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"38\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:38\" class=\"v\">38</span>¶ If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, <span class=\"add\">even</span> white bright spots; <span data-number=\"39\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:39\" class=\"v\">39</span>Then the priest shall look: and, behold, <span class=\"add\">if</span> the bright spots in the skin of their flesh <span class=\"add\">be</span> darkish white; it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a freckled spot <span class=\"add\">that</span> groweth in the skin; he <span class=\"add\">is</span> clean. <span data-number=\"40\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:40\" class=\"v\">40</span>And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he <span class=\"add\">is</span> bald; <span class=\"add\">yet is</span> he clean. <span data-number=\"41\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:41\" class=\"v\">41</span>And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he <span class=\"add\">is</span> forehead bald: <span class=\"add\">yet is</span> he clean. <span data-number=\"42\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:42\" class=\"v\">42</span>And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead. <span data-number=\"43\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:43\" class=\"v\">43</span>Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, <span class=\"add\">if</span> the rising of the sore <span class=\"add\">be</span> white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; <span data-number=\"44\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:44\" class=\"v\">44</span>He is a leprous man, he <span class=\"add\">is</span> unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague <span class=\"add\">is</span> in his head. <span data-number=\"45\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:45\" class=\"v\">45</span>And the leper in whom the plague <span class=\"add\">is</span>, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean. <span data-number=\"46\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:46\" class=\"v\">46</span>All the days wherein the plague <span class=\"add\">shall be</span> in him he shall be defiled; he <span class=\"add\">is</span> unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp <span class=\"add\">shall</span> his habitation <span class=\"add\">be</span>.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"47\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:47\" class=\"v\">47</span>¶ The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, <span class=\"add\">whether it be</span> a woollen garment, or a linen garment; <span data-number=\"48\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:48\" class=\"v\">48</span>Whether <span class=\"add\">it be</span> in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin; <span data-number=\"49\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:49\" class=\"v\">49</span>And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest: <span data-number=\"50\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:50\" class=\"v\">50</span>And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up <span class=\"add\">it that hath</span> the plague seven days: <span data-number=\"51\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:51\" class=\"v\">51</span>And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, <span class=\"add\">or</span> in any work that is made of skin; the plague <span class=\"add\">is</span> a fretting leprosy; it <span class=\"add\">is</span> unclean. <span data-number=\"52\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:52\" class=\"v\">52</span>He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire. <span data-number=\"53\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:53\" class=\"v\">53</span>And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; <span data-number=\"54\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:54\" class=\"v\">54</span>Then the priest shall command that they wash <span class=\"add\">the thing</span> wherein the plague <span class=\"add\">is</span>, and he shall shut it up seven days more: <span data-number=\"55\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:55\" class=\"v\">55</span>And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, <span class=\"add\">if</span> the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it <span class=\"add\">is</span> unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it <span class=\"add\">is</span> fret inward, <span class=\"add\">whether</span> it <span class=\"add\">be</span> bare within or without. <span data-number=\"56\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:56\" class=\"v\">56</span>And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague <span class=\"add\">be</span> somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: <span data-number=\"57\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:57\" class=\"v\">57</span>And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it <span class=\"add\">is</span> a spreading <span class=\"add\">plague:</span> thou shalt burn that wherein the plague <span class=\"add\">is</span> with fire. <span data-number=\"58\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:58\" class=\"v\">58</span>And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin <span class=\"add\">it be</span>, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean. <span data-number=\"59\" data-sid=\"LEV 13:59\" class=\"v\">59</span>This <span class=\"add\">is</span> the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.</p>",
