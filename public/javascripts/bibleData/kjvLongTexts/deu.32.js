thy elders, and they will tell thee. <span data-number=\"8\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:8\" class=\"v\">8</span>When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel. <span data-number=\"9\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:9\" class=\"v\">9</span>For the <span class=\"nd\">LORD’s</span> portion <span class=\"add\">is</span> his people; Jacob <span class=\"add\">is</span> the lot of his inheritance. <span data-number=\"10\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:10\" class=\"v\">10</span>He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. <span data-number=\"11\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:11\" class=\"v\">11</span>As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: <span data-number=\"12\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:12\" class=\"v\">12</span><span class=\"add\">So</span> the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> alone did lead him, and <span class=\"add\">there was</span> no strange god with him. <span data-number=\"13\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:13\" class=\"v\">13</span>He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; <span data-number=\"14\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:14\" class=\"v\">14</span>Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"15\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:15\" class=\"v\">15</span>¶ But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered <span class=\"add\">with fatness;</span> then he forsook God <span class=\"add\">which</span> made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. <span data-number=\"16\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:16\" class=\"v\">16</span>They provoked him to jealousy with strange <span class=\"add\">gods</span>, with abominations provoked they him to anger. <span data-number=\"17\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:17\" class=\"v\">17</span>They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new <span class=\"add\">gods that</span> came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. <span data-number=\"18\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:18\" class=\"v\">18</span>Of the Rock <span class=\"add\">that</span> begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"19\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:19\" class=\"v\">19</span>And when the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> saw <span class=\"add\">it</span>, he abhorred <span class=\"add\">them</span>, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters. <span data-number=\"20\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:20\" class=\"v\">20</span>And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end <span class=\"add\">shall be:</span> for they <span class=\"add\">are</span> a very froward generation, children in whom <span class=\"add\">is</span> no faith. <span data-number=\"21\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:21\" class=\"v\">21</span>They have moved me to jealousy with <span class=\"add\">that which is</span> not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with <span class=\"add\">those which are</span> not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. <span data-number=\"22\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:22\" class=\"v\">22</span>For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains. <span data-number=\"23\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:23\" class=\"v\">23</span>I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them. <span data-number=\"24\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:24\" class=\"v\">24</span><span class=\"add\">They shall be</span> burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust. <span data-number=\"25\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:25\" class=\"v\">25</span>The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling <span class=\"add\">also</span> with the man of gray hairs.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"26\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:26\" class=\"v\">26</span>I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men: <span data-number=\"27\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:27\" class=\"v\">27</span>Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, <span class=\"add\">and</span> lest they should say, Our hand <span class=\"add\">is</span> high, and the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> hath not done all this. <span data-number=\"28\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:28\" class=\"v\">28</span>For they <span class=\"add\">are</span> a nation void of counsel, neither <span class=\"add\">is there any</span> understanding in them. <span data-number=\"29\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:29\" class=\"v\">29</span>O that they were wise, <span class=\"add\">that</span> they understood this, <span class=\"add\">that</span> they would consider their latter end! <span data-number=\"30\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:30\" class=\"v\">30</span>How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> had shut them up? <span data-number=\"31\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:31\" class=\"v\">31</span>For their rock <span class=\"add\">is</span> not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves <span class=\"add\">being</span> judges. <span data-number=\"32\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:32\" class=\"v\">32</span>For their vine <span class=\"add\">is</span> of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes <span class=\"add\">are</span> grapes of gall, their clusters <span class=\"add\">are</span> bitter: <span data-number=\"33\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:33\" class=\"v\">33</span>Their wine <span class=\"add\">is</span> the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps. <span data-number=\"34\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:34\" class=\"v\">34</span><span class=\"add\">Is</span> not this laid up in store with me, <span class=\"add\">and</span> sealed up among my treasures? <span data-number=\"35\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:35\" class=\"v\">35</span>To me <span class=\"add\">belongeth</span> vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in <span class=\"add\">due</span> time: for the day of their calamity <span class=\"add\">is</span> at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. <span data-number=\"36\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:36\" class=\"v\">36</span>For the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that <span class=\"add\">their</span> power is gone, and <span class=\"add\">there is</span> none shut up, or left. <span data-number=\"37\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:37\" class=\"v\">37</span>And he shall say, Where <span class=\"add\">are</span> their gods, <span class=\"add\">their</span> rock in whom they trusted, <span data-number=\"38\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:38\" class=\"v\">38</span>Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, <span class=\"add\">and</span> drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, <span class=\"add\">and</span> be your protection.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"39\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:39\" class=\"v\">39</span>See now that I, <span class=\"add\">even</span> I, <span class=\"add\">am</span> he, and <span class=\"add\">there is</span> no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither <span class=\"add\">is there any</span> that can deliver out of my hand. <span data-number=\"40\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:40\" class=\"v\">40</span>For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. <span data-number=\"41\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:41\" class=\"v\">41</span>If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. <span data-number=\"42\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:42\" class=\"v\">42</span>I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; <span class=\"add\">and that</span> with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. <span data-number=\"43\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:43\" class=\"v\">43</span>Rejoice, O ye nations, <span class=\"add\">with</span> his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, <span class=\"add\">and</span> to his people.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"44\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:44\" class=\"v\">44</span>¶ And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. <span data-number=\"45\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:45\" class=\"v\">45</span>And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel: <span data-number=\"46\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:46\" class=\"v\">46</span>And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law. <span data-number=\"47\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:47\" class=\"v\">47</span>For it <span class=\"add\">is</span> not a vain thing for you; because it <span class=\"add\">is</span> your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong <span class=\"add\">your</span> days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it. <span data-number=\"48\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:48\" class=\"v\">48</span>And the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, <span data-number=\"49\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:49\" class=\"v\">49</span>Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, <span class=\"add\">unto</span> mount Nebo, which <span class=\"add\">is</span> in the land of Moab, that <span class=\"add\">is</span> over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession: <span data-number=\"50\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:50\" class=\"v\">50</span>And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people: <span data-number=\"51\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:51\" class=\"v\">51</span>Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. <span data-number=\"52\" data-sid=\"DEU 32:52\" class=\"v\">52</span>Yet thou shalt see the land before <span class=\"add\">thee;</span> but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.</p>",
