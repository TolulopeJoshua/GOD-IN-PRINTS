for the locust shall consume it. <span data-number=\"39\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:39\" class=\"v\">39</span>Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress <span class=\"add\">them</span>, but shalt neither drink <span class=\"add\">of</span> the wine, nor gather <span class=\"add\">the grapes;</span> for the worms shall eat them. <span data-number=\"40\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:40\" class=\"v\">40</span>Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint <span class=\"add\">thyself</span> with the oil; for thine olive shall cast <span class=\"add\">his fruit</span>. <span data-number=\"41\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:41\" class=\"v\">41</span>Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them;

and thou shalt come down very low. <span data-number=\"44\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:44\" class=\"v\">44</span>He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"45\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:45\" class=\"v\">45</span>Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee: <span data-number=\"46\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:46\" class=\"v\">46</span>And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever. <span data-number=\"47\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:47\" class=\"v\">47</span>Because thou servedst not the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all <span class=\"add\">things;</span> <span data-number=\"48\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:48\" class=\"v\">48</span>Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all <span class=\"add\">things:</span> and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee. <span data-number=\"49\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:49\" class=\"v\">49</span>The <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, <span class=\"add\">as swift</span> as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand; <span data-number=\"50\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:50\" class=\"v\">50</span>A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young: <span data-number=\"51\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:51\" class=\"v\">51</span>And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which <span class=\"add\">also</span> shall not leave thee <span class=\"add\">either</span> corn, wine, or oil, <span class=\"add\">or</span> the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee. <span data-number=\"52\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:52\" class=\"v\">52</span>And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> thy God hath given thee. <span data-number=\"53\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:53\" class=\"v\">53</span>And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee: <span data-number=\"54\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:54\" class=\"v\">54</span><span class=\"add\">So that</span> the man <span class=\"add\">that is</span> tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave: <span data-number=\"55\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:55\" class=\"v\">55</span>So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates. <span data-number=\"56\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:56\" class=\"v\">56</span>The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, <span data-number=\"57\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:57\" class=\"v\">57</span>And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all <span class=\"add\">things</span> secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates. <span data-number=\"58\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:58\" class=\"v\">58</span>If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> THY GOD; <span data-number=\"59\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:59\" class=\"v\">59</span>Then the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, <span class=\"add\">even</span> great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance. <span data-number=\"60\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:60\" class=\"v\">60</span>Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. <span data-number=\"61\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:61\" class=\"v\">61</span>Also every sickness, and every plague, which <span class=\"add\">is</span> not written in the book of this law, them will the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed. <span data-number=\"62\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:62\" class=\"v\">62</span>And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> thy God. <span data-number=\"63\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:63\" class=\"v\">63</span>And it shall come to pass, <span class=\"add\">that</span> as the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it. <span data-number=\"64\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:64\" class=\"v\">64</span>And the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, <span class=\"add\">even</span> wood and stone. <span data-number=\"65\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:65\" class=\"v\">65</span>And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: <span data-number=\"66\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:66\" class=\"v\">66</span>And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: <span data-number=\"67\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:67\" class=\"v\">67</span>In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. <span data-number=\"68\" data-sid=\"DEU 28:68\" class=\"v\">68</span>And the <span class=\"nd\">LORD</span> shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy <span class=\"add\">you</span>.</p>",
