Audiences will be treated to a stronger portrayal of Jesus that peeks at his childhood and family upbringing. The result is a Jesus that invokes empathy and sheds light on the true magnitude of his sacrifice for mankind.\n\nDirected by Jesse Low\nWritten by DJ Perry\nStarring DJ Perry, Rance Howard, Taymour Ghazi"

        "title": "Sabina K. (2015) | Full Movie | Dragan Micanovic | Alena Dzebo | Alban Ukaj",
        "description": "(Faith, Drama, Catholic)\n\nSabina K. is inspired by a true story set in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The \"Sabina\" of the title plans to marry Sasa (with whom she served during the Bosnian War), but there is a problem. Sabina is \nMuslim and Sasa a Catholic, and their respective families disapprove of the marriage. Their only ally is an older woman, Ankica, whose son - killed in the war - had been their close friend. \"Aunt\" Ankica thinks of Sabina and Sasa as her own children and invites them to her home on the island of Korcula to get married. Springtime comes and Sabina travels to Korcula where she is reunited with Ankica and where the two women wait for Sasa to join them from Zagreb. The days pass... Sasa never arrives... and with a heavy and troubled heart, Sabina returns to Sarajevo. She discovers that Sasa has taken all his things from her apartment and moved out. There is no note; no explanation. Sabina goes to Sasa's mother for answers, but the deeply embittered woman treats her harshly and calls the police. Mysteriously, inexplicably, the love of Sabina's life is gone and she doesn't know where or why. A few weeks later, Sabina passes out on the job. She goes to the doctor and learns that she is pregnant. Her parents and friends counsel her to have an abortion and put the past behind her, but she refuses. As her pregnancy advances and winter approaches, Sabina loses her job and when her ex-husband tries to shake her down for money by threatening to take the children away permanently, she comes to a breaking point. Love has failed her, and she decides to take her life. The suicide attempt is unsuccessful and Sabina spends several days in the hospital. While there, she is visited by her landlady, who informs her that since her lease will end in another week, she has decided to rent out Sabina's apartment to another family. Feeling abandoned by family and friends, and with no help from social services, Sabina wanders the streets of Sarajevo in the bitter cold of winter. There are no solutions... there is no refuge... and Sabina again makes plans to take her life. She sells the last of her jewelry and surreptitiously buys three times the amount of sleeping pills used in her previous suicide attempt. She checks into a room at a motel and begins swallowing the pills, slipping into unconsciousness. What happens next is subject to opinion... But one thing becomes clear. Sabina will never be the same.\n\nDirector: Cristobal Krusen\nWriter: Cristobal Krusen\nStars: Dragan Micanovic, Alena Dzebo, Alban Ukaj\n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3FU1Yeu\n\n► About\nDeep C Digital is one of the largest and trusted independent movie and TV distributors in the United States, providing outstanding content for today’s digital consumers.

          "description": "(Faith, Drama, Catholic)\n\nSabina K. is inspired by a true story set in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The \"Sabina\" of the title plans to marry Sasa (with whom she served during the Bosnian War), but there is a problem. Sabina is \nMuslim and Sasa a Catholic, and their respective families disapprove of the marriage. Their only ally is an older woman, Ankica, whose son - killed in the war - had been their close friend. \"Aunt\" Ankica thinks of Sabina and Sasa as her own children and invites them to her home on the island of Korcula to get married. Springtime comes and Sabina travels to Korcula where she is reunited with Ankica and where the two women wait for Sasa to join them from Zagreb. The days pass... Sasa never arrives... and with a heavy and troubled heart, Sabina returns to Sarajevo. She discovers that Sasa has taken all his things from her apartment and moved out. There is no note; no explanation. Sabina goes to Sasa's mother for answers, but the deeply embittered woman treats her harshly and calls the police. Mysteriously, inexplicably, the love of Sabina's life is gone and she doesn't know where or why. A few weeks later, Sabina passes out on the job. She goes to the doctor and learns that she is pregnant. Her parents and friends counsel her to have an abortion and put the past behind her, but she refuses. As her pregnancy advances and winter approaches, Sabina loses her job and when her ex-husband tries to shake her down for money by threatening to take the children away permanently, she comes to a breaking point. Love has failed her, and she decides to take her life. The suicide attempt is unsuccessful and Sabina spends several days in the hospital. While there, she is visited by her landlady, who informs her that since her lease will end in another week, she has decided to rent out Sabina's apartment to another family. Feeling abandoned by family and friends, and with no help from social services, Sabina wanders the streets of Sarajevo in the bitter cold of winter. There are no solutions... there is no refuge... and Sabina again makes plans to take her life. She sells the last of her jewelry and surreptitiously buys three times the amount of sleeping pills used in her previous suicide attempt. She checks into a room at a motel and begins swallowing the pills, slipping into unconsciousness. What happens next is subject to opinion... But one thing becomes clear. Sabina will never be the same.\n\nDirector: Cristobal Krusen\nWriter: Cristobal Krusen\nStars: Dragan Micanovic, Alena Dzebo, Alban Ukaj\n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3FU1Yeu\n\n► About\nDeep C Digital is one of the largest and trusted independent movie and TV distributors in the United States, providing outstanding content for today’s digital consumers.

It has produced passionate controversy for centuries.  What is the book that is like none other in the history of the world?  Where did it come from?  What does it consist of?  Does it still speak to us today? Program 2: The Old Testament\nAn ancient book?  Yes, but far more!  It's a kind of love letter and a still-living legacy that shaped the identity of a unique people.  What about the Dead Sea Scrolls?  The accurate preservation of the contents over millennia underscores the marvel of these writings. Program 3: The New Testament\nIt's a book that centers on Jesus.  But how do we know we have the actual words of Jesus?  How were the books of the New Testament gathered and selected?  What’s it all about?  How does the New Testament build upon but differ from the Old Testament? Program 4: Survival, Spread, and Influence\nDespite attempts of tyrants to destroy it, the Bible has endured and become the most translated and circulated book ever.

        "description": "Chloe’s Mountain is a story of a purpose driven Grandma who is raising her granddaughter (Chloe) who does not understand God and why her parents were taken from her.  In her misunderstanding and anger, Chloe abandons her Christian upbringing and joins a rock band who draw her into their misguided ideas. Grandma has her work cut out for her, but she has a plan that could only have been conceived in the heavens. After Grandma’s passes away, Chloe finds out how wise she was.  To receive her generous estate, Chloe must either attend 4 years at a Christian university or wait until she is 35. Chloe reluctantly ops for the 4 years, not understanding that you cannot fake it that long. Her newfound friends and the Holy Spirit begin to change her heart and teach her how to see the workings of God to level the mountains of doubt and pain in her life.\n\nDirected by Wesley Bristol\nStarring Kenzie Mae, Donna Bristol, Shalayna Janelle, Adam Thayer",

        "description": "PARENTAL DISCRETION IS ADVISED\nA highly ambitious second-rung corporate executive, Victor Sandeman, is losing his lifestyle as a result of poor investments. He sees a way out via a company merger, but the old man who runs the business opposes the deal. Victor decides to murder the old-timer so his weak-willed grandson will be in charge. But, while carrying out his plan, with the old man's body still in the trunk, he rear ends a vehicle. The driver whose car is hit, Christine Sternwald, remains adamant that all the information needed for insurance purposes be provided. This leaves Victor in a quandary. He makes up his mind to get rid of the accidental witness. This leads to several neat complications in the story involving mistaken identity, frustrating lures, and a police investigation into a homicide made to look like a heart attack leading to a car crash.\n\nDirector: Kristoffer Tabori\nWriter: Michael Rhodes\nStarring Natasha Gregson Wagner, Currie Graham, Aaron Pearl",

But behind the closed doors of his Bethesda, Maryland home, Kurt's life is far from perfect. An alcoholic mother (Nancy Fondriest), a power hungry father (Michael Landers), and a family tragedy make this suburban dream home a living nightmare. When Kurt gets cut at the end of his freshman basketball season, all that he's worked for crumbles. But this is far from the final word on Kurt's future. Buoyed by friends (Robby Stone, Danny Cornett, Chelsie Casagrande) and his new found faith in God, Kurt discovers courage and his true calling.\n\nDirector: Donald Leow\nWriters: Chris Craddock (as Chris Craddock), Katherine Craddock\nCast: Jason Burkey, Chelsie Casagrande, Jean-Paul Chreky\n\nOther movies recommended on our Christian Movies YouTube channel:\nPower of the Air - https://youtu.be/sjEWbpGvswo\nA Dave Christiano Film",

        "description": "Miles and Kate just want to live a normal, happy life. When Miles O'Rourke's brother shows him the hidden Mayflower II, a spaceship designed to help families escape persecution, he dismisses it as paranoia. ...however, the persecution soon becomes personal. Caught off guard, he \"borrows\" the new Mayflower to escape to a utopian colony on Mars where he learns he hasn't left all his troubles behind. 400 years ago the original Mayflower carried persecuted believers to the new world. In this futuristic action packed thriller the Mayflower II will take persecuted believers to another world. Highlighting the need for faithfulness and courage in the face of opposition this riveting story explores faith in both strength and weakness, and takes viewers on a journey to discover where true peace and courage come from. YOU AND YOUR FAMILY WILL: 1. Be challenged to consider where you stand with God. 2. Consider what your response should be in the face of looming persecution. 3. Learn that true courage comes from fearing God, not man. Mayflower II is an encouraging, inspiring, and exciting movie for the whole family to enjoy.\n\nDirector: Dallas Lammiman\nWriter: Greg Lammiman\nStars: Rick Borger, D'Arcy Browning, Tree Browning\n\n– Want to watch Mayflower II ad free? –\nBuy the movie here: https://tinyurl.com/prp62hr3 and use the coupon code “CHRISTIANMOVIES” for 60% off the digital edition!\n+ Get access to alternate edits, behind the scenes, and other special features!\n\n– Know someone who needs to see this movie?

          "description": "Miles and Kate just want to live a normal, happy life. When Miles O'Rourke's brother shows him the hidden Mayflower II, a spaceship designed to help families escape persecution, he dismisses it as paranoia. ...however, the persecution soon becomes personal. Caught off guard, he \"borrows\" the new Mayflower to escape to a utopian colony on Mars where he learns he hasn't left all his troubles behind. 400 years ago the original Mayflower carried persecuted believers to the new world. In this futuristic action packed thriller the Mayflower II will take persecuted believers to another world. Highlighting the need for faithfulness and courage in the face of opposition this riveting story explores faith in both strength and weakness, and takes viewers on a journey to discover where true peace and courage come from. YOU AND YOUR FAMILY WILL: 1. Be challenged to consider where you stand with God. 2. Consider what your response should be in the face of looming persecution. 3. Learn that true courage comes from fearing God, not man. Mayflower II is an encouraging, inspiring, and exciting movie for the whole family to enjoy.\n\nDirector: Dallas Lammiman\nWriter: Greg Lammiman\nStars: Rick Borger, D'Arcy Browning, Tree Browning\n\n– Want to watch Mayflower II ad free? –\nBuy the movie here: https://tinyurl.com/prp62hr3 and use the coupon code “CHRISTIANMOVIES” for 60% off the digital edition!\n+ Get access to alternate edits, behind the scenes, and other special features!\n\n– Know someone who needs to see this movie?

        "description": "Set in the early 1970's, this is one of the most and widely viewed motion pictures of all time. A Thief in the Night tells the story of Patty, a young woman caught up in living for the present with little concern for the future. She meets and marries a young man and her life seems great, until one morning she awakens to find her husband gone and the radio reporting that millions of people have mysteriously disappeared.

A Thief in the Night tells the story of Patty, a young woman caught up in living for the present with little concern for the future. She meets and marries a young man and her life seems great, until one morning she awakens to find her husband gone and the radio reporting that millions of people have mysteriously disappeared. As dramatic, earth shaking events begin to unfold around her, Patty realizes she is living in the End Times spoken of in biblical prophecy.

          "description": "One of the best high school love stories ever made, Love Note follows the story of a Christian teenager named Craig who was looking for a challenge. When a new girl shows up in school, the one with an attitude, he tries to befriend her but does not succeed. Her candid remarks, rudeness, and distance pushes him away. As his curiosity about who she is grows, so does the story of this movie. This evangelistic drama has two good performances by Craig Bierko and Sally Murphy, a great song, some good humor and is heartfelt.\n\nDirector: Steve Grill\nWriter: James Cook\nCast: Craig Bierko, Sally Murphy\n\nOther movies recommended on our Christian Movies YouTube channel:\nPower of the Air - https://youtu.be/sjEWbpGvswo\nA Dave Christiano Film"

An abandoned water truck was found in the Thai countryside containing more than 100 trafficked migrants; some 50 died while others disappeared. His investigation centers on The Pearl, a popular destination for sex tourists, and the place where Jason poses as a john so he can secretly meet with women and girls forced to work as prostitutes. Certain a young girl known only as Number 18 can be a key witness for his case, Jason must convince 18 to testify against her cut throat pimp. As Jason starts to build a relationship with 18, he sees in her reflections of the young daughters he has left far away at home in the USA. The riddle to solve the secrets of the abandoned water truck gets more complicated for Jason and his boss Marta when they come under increasing pressure from power brokers in Washington DC who are finalizing a key Asian trade deal. When his investigation starts to unravel, Jason realizes that rather than save 18 from her horrific circumstances he has put her life at risk. With a crime syndicate now chasing him down and no resources but his own wits, Jason must try to rescue 18 in the crowded city before the pimp moves her, for good.\n\nDirected by Matthew Kooman, Daniel Kooman\nStarring Giovanni Mocibob, Will Yun Lee, Eugenia Yuan, Teresa Ting, Gil Bellows\n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3aOfZft\n\n► About \nEncourageTV brings you the best selection of FREE Family-Friendly, Kid-Friendly, Faith-Friendly and Christian content available anywhere!

When she strikes up a romance with the wealthy Ted, a guy she grew up admiring from afar at school, and says yes to marrying him, she thinks she’s finally found her soul mate and is immediately brought into a much more luxurious world than she’s used to. That world also includes Ted’s seductive twin brother Frank, whose affections for her go beyond family admiration.\n\nWhile Ted took his inheritance and launched a successful global technology business, Frank took the opposite approach and traveled the country, leaving a trail of run-ins with the law and one night stands. Now, back in town and living in his family’s old home, Frank’s long buried jealousy of everything his brother has, including Emma, comes to the surface.\n\nSuffering from black outs and manic episodes, related to a traumatizing event when he was younger, Frank quickly becomes a danger for anyone to be around. Soon Emma realizes that coming between the twin brothers is more dangerous than she imagined as she discovers their darkest secrets.",

Andrea, unable to defend her daughter, calls the police, but it’s too late: Andrea watches in horror, via Skype, as the man rapes her daughter.\nA few months later, Andrea and Jodi leave the city, moving to a nice house in a pretty suburban neighborhood. Andrea (Amy Pietz “Caroline in the City”) is certain they have left their problems behind them, but Jodi, now emotionally traumatized, is fearful of her new surroundings.\nA few nights later, while Jodi (Kelcie Stranahan “Last Hours in Suburbia”) takes photographs from her bedroom window, she looks across the street to see an ominous shadow in her neighbor’s house. Is she watching a home invasion? Has her nightmare returned?",

Frederick Douglass, No Turning Back is set in 1872, Ohio, where Frederick Douglass is on a national tour. The pastor (Clarence Felder) introduces him to his integrated church. Douglass then gives an electrifying sermon on his breathtaking journey from slavery to author, newspaper editor, and leading American statesmen.  One of our greatest heroes, Douglass had many triumphs, including helping pass Amendments to the US Constitution. He reveals his life in the North, in London, and as a Christian leader, with wit and wisdom. He could have lived in Europe but felt God's call to return to America to win freedom for all.

A kindergarten teacher, Peter spends his days creating make-believe and arts and crafts while Alex spends hers deconstructing the mysteries of the universe. Much to Peter’s chagrin, Alex’s father has made sure Max has been raised with the same ‘sensibilities’ as Alex, including making sure he knows Santa is just a thing of stories and lies....",

        "description": "During WWII, the invasion of Pearl Harbor took the lives of thousands. This story narrows on the life of Kate Kensington who lost her fiancé, William, in that battle. Unable to bear the grief, Kate falls into a deep depression ending tragically with her taking her own life. Her body is never recovered. Reports are made of her apparition at the cemetery where William was buried and in the surrounding woods and the legend is born. The story then moves to the present day, where a clairvoyant young girl, Hayley Jennings, learns of the legend of Kate and begins having reoccurring vivid nightmares about her. Hayley begins seeing the silhouette of her, hearing her voice and through her dreams leans of a dark secret Kate's family kept from the public explaining why her spirit remains. Will Hayley be able to use her gift to help Kate, or is this secret so dark that uncovering it is too dangerous? Terrified, Hayley looks to God for strength.\n\nDirected by Bradley Castillo\nStarring Hayley Castillo, Melony Daemer, David McDivitt\n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3aOfZft\n\n► About \nEncourageTV brings you the best selection of FREE Family-Friendly, Kid-Friendly, Faith-Friendly and Christian content available anywhere!

Only two things stand in Luke's way: new-surfer-in-town Matt who has his own eyes set on the surf team opening, and his Dad, who insists he give up his surfing dreams and get an education. When a devastating tragedy strikes, Luke is forced to take a hard look at his life and with the help of beautiful \"church-girl\" Emily and his Youth Pastor , he learns that there's much more to life than riding waves.\n\nDirectors: Lance Bachelder, Johnny Remo\nWriters: Lance Bachelder, Daniel Backman, (story) Johnny Remo (story)\nStars: Justin Schwan, Kelsey Sanders, Raquel Gardner, Angel Cruz, Greg Carlson, Andy Shephard, Danny Smith\n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3FU1Yeu\n\n► About\nDeep C Digital is one of the largest and trusted independent movie and TV distributors in the United States, providing outstanding content for today’s digital consumers.

        "description": "In 1244, during a time of religious persecution, Pope Innocent IV and King Louis IX of France sought to eradicate a pacifist Christian group known as Cathars. The last of the Cathar heretics found protection at the Castle of Montsegur. Here a dedicated group of about 100 defending knights, under the Leadership of Lord Raymond and his family, held a crusading army of over 10,000 mercenaries at bay for 9 months. To this day, many people believe that the Cathars were the guardians of a treasure of great significance, possibly even the Holy Grail. It is rumoured that in the last days of the siege a small group managed to slip away in the dead of night to retrieve this hidden treasure and get it safely away from the clutches of the Catholic Church.

He couldn’t save his wife from cancer – and worse yet – his 6-year-old daughter, Tiffany, is now facing the same possible fate. When he finds himself in a cold jail cell after attacking a pastor out of frustration with a seemingly absent God, Tom begins to reflect on his downward spiral into despair. But with the help and persistent friendship of the very man he assaulted, Tom is challenged to face his grief and embrace faith in the darkest hours of his life.\n\nDirected by Joel Paul Reisig\nStarring Dean Cain, Kevin Sorbo, Nick Vlassopoulous",

When he finds himself in a cold jail cell after attacking a pastor out of frustration with a seemingly absent God, Tom begins to reflect on his downward spiral into despair. But with the help and persistent friendship of the very man he assaulted, Tom is challenged to face his grief and embrace faith in the darkest hours of his life.\n\nDirected by Joel Paul Reisig\nStarring Dean Cain, Kevin Sorbo, Nick Vlassopoulous"

        "description": "(Drama, Inspiration)\nA man (Mike Norris) and a woman help a teenager (Ali Faulkner) after she runs away from her adoptive mother (Janine Turner).\n\nMaggie (Ali Faulker) is an 18 year-old girl who leaves her adopted Christian home after her father's tragic death. Trying to fill a void in her life, Maggie feels the need to locate her birth mother. What she finds is not what she hoped for. Maggie finds a mother that does not love her or want her. Maggie gets caught up in this woman's world. After a few months enough becomes enough and when all hope is lost, one desperate night she reaches her breaking point. In a rage, she releases her frustrations by destroying the seedy hotel room that has been her home. At her feet falls a Bible, and it is then she realizes that there is only one thing that can break the bondage she is in and that is Jesus Christ our Savior. She realizes through God's Word that he has a better plan for her life. Finding the courage she runs away from the nightmare she has been living. With the faith of a mustard seed, Maggie has no place to go but living on the streets alone, broke and scared. Maggie meets just the right people, Max and Grace, who will make her passage a reality. Grace (Sheran Keyton Goodspeed) gives her shelter and wisdom, while Max (Mike Norris), broken himself, becomes a father figure. These two take Maggie under their wings and help her get to where she belongs, at home with her adopted mother (Janine Turner) who has been praying for her safe return.\n\nDirector: Mike Norris\nWriters: Chris Bessey, Raymond Normandin, Mike Norris\nStars: Grant Barker, Ron Bath, Barry Brown, Janine Turner, Ali Faulker, Sheran Keyton",

        "description": "The journey shows us what sound a spoiled young rock star makes when she is out of tune with life and how far her understudy will go to replace her. Star is the center of her universe when she discovers how small it really is. Paths cross between those climbing up the ladder, those falling off, and those putting the ladder away. This fresh, contemporary film offers the sounds of classical, rock, and bluegrass colliding as lives intersect, resulting in a new sound, a new life, a new beginning. In the end, Star discovers that the art to fine tuning her life is much like tuning a violin so she is in harmony with those around her, as she finds the family she never had.\n\nDirector: Nina May\nStars: Joshua Blake, Scott Clark, Kristine Cornils\n\nCast\nJoshua Blake as Henry\nScott Clark as Joshua Madison\nKristine Cornils as Martha Madison\nKeith Donaldson as Doc\nVictoria Emmons as Star\nGalen Ryan Kane as Billy (as Galen Kane)\nAlveda King as Tune Toss Granny\nJoseph Logue as Tom Morris\nLily Love Loudon as Fan\nBrandon Millett as Jim Madison\nJosh Murray as Mack\nRon Newcomb as Brian\nJennie Marie O'Keefe as Cassie",

They almost married each other in their twenties but Evelyn got cold feet. Later Evelyn married one of Jonathan's divorced friends Thomas, and left her Catholic faith rather than wait for him to obtain an annulment. Jonathan had encouraged her many times to return to the faith during her marriage but she resisted. When Evelyn approaches Jonathan insisting they try to stop their children's marriage, both Evelyn and Jonathan's true feelings for each other emerge. Will Evelyn return to the faith and marry Jonathan, or remain estranged?\n\nDirector: Marc Leif\nWriter: Michael C. Mergler\nStars: Mitch Teemley, Christine Jones and Chuck Gillespie",

          "description": "(Drama, Catholic)\n\nSet over Easter weekend, Evelyn and Jonathan - both widowed and in their fifties - meet again when their children fall in love with each other. They almost married each other in their twenties but Evelyn got cold feet. Later Evelyn married one of Jonathan's divorced friends Thomas, and left her Catholic faith rather than wait for him to obtain an annulment. Jonathan had encouraged her many times to return to the faith during her marriage but she resisted. When Evelyn approaches Jonathan insisting they try to stop their children's marriage, both Evelyn and Jonathan's true feelings for each other emerge. Will Evelyn return to the faith and marry Jonathan, or remain estranged?\n\nDirector: Marc Leif\nWriter: Michael C. Mergler\nStars: Mitch Teemley, Christine Jones and Chuck Gillespie"

        "description": "Based on a true story, this powerful drama demonstrates how obedience to Biblical principles can overcome the problems of permissiveness and lack of leadership in today’s family. A house in the suburbs, two handsome boys and a dog - All is calm at the Donavan household. Or is it? Kathy Donavan is frustrated by Jim's \"boys will be boys\" attitude toward discipline. Jim can't understand Kathy's new-found religion. Young Jeff is out of control. When grandpa Ollie comes to live with them, a three generation conflict brews. With a tiger loose in the city and a python in the school. Home Safe is alive with action, suspense, humor and tragedy.\n\nDirector: Donald W. Thompson\nWriters: Russell S. Doughten Jr., Donald W.

        "description": "The Forbidden Book Full Movie, is directed by Brian Barkley and features Craig Lampe, Jim Birdsall.\n\nThe Forbidden Book is unlike anything you have ever seen before. Hosted by Dr. Craig Lampe, this one-hour documentary takes you on a fascinating journey through time. Follow our film crew across Europe as we SHOW YOU all the important places of Christian history.\n\nLearn how God’s Word was originally scribed in Hebrew and Greek. Walk with Dr. Lampe among the ruins of the very first Christian Church ever built above ground… not in Israel, but in England! Discover how the Word was preserved through the 1,000 year period of the Dark and Middle Ages, when possession of scripture in any language other than Latin meant certain death at the hands of the organized church. Uncover the truth about the misunderstood books called “Apocrypha” that were printed in every Protestant Christian’s Bible until 1885.\n\nMeet John Wycliffe, the first person to translate the Bible into English… and see his church, which is still offering Sunday services today, as it has since the 1300’s. Look at the door where Martin Luther, the first person to print the Bible in German, nailed his 95 Theses, starting the Protestant Reformation. See William Tyndale’s illegal printing shop, which is a book store today, and find out why Tyndale was executed for being the first person to print the scriptures in English. Find out about the 1535 first complete printed English Bible of Myles Coverdale, the 1537 Matthews Bible, and King Henry the Eighth’s 1539 “Great Bible” …the first legal English Bible.\n\nLearn why the Bible of the Protestant Reformation, the 1560 English Geneva Bible, had to be printed in Switzerland due to the reign of Queen “Bloody” Mary. See how the 1568 Bishops Bible was revised to become the 1611 King James Bible, and how the King James version slowly replaced the much more popular Geneva Bible among early American Colonists.\n\n“The Forbidden Book” is simply the most captivating and informative video ever produced on the subject of how we got the Bible, and how God has preserved His Word for thousands of years to countless generations.\n\nDirector: Brian Barkley\nWriter: Craig Lampe\nStarring: Craig Lampe, Jim Birdsall",

          "description": "The Forbidden Book Full Movie, is directed by Brian Barkley and features Craig Lampe, Jim Birdsall.\n\nThe Forbidden Book is unlike anything you have ever seen before. Hosted by Dr. Craig Lampe, this one-hour documentary takes you on a fascinating journey through time. Follow our film crew across Europe as we SHOW YOU all the important places of Christian history.\n\nLearn how God’s Word was originally scribed in Hebrew and Greek. Walk with Dr. Lampe among the ruins of the very first Christian Church ever built above ground… not in Israel, but in England! Discover how the Word was preserved through the 1,000 year period of the Dark and Middle Ages, when possession of scripture in any language other than Latin meant certain death at the hands of the organized church. Uncover the truth about the misunderstood books called “Apocrypha” that were printed in every Protestant Christian’s Bible until 1885.\n\nMeet John Wycliffe, the first person to translate the Bible into English… and see his church, which is still offering Sunday services today, as it has since the 1300’s. Look at the door where Martin Luther, the first person to print the Bible in German, nailed his 95 Theses, starting the Protestant Reformation. See William Tyndale’s illegal printing shop, which is a book store today, and find out why Tyndale was executed for being the first person to print the scriptures in English. Find out about the 1535 first complete printed English Bible of Myles Coverdale, the 1537 Matthews Bible, and King Henry the Eighth’s 1539 “Great Bible” …the first legal English Bible.\n\nLearn why the Bible of the Protestant Reformation, the 1560 English Geneva Bible, had to be printed in Switzerland due to the reign of Queen “Bloody” Mary. See how the 1568 Bishops Bible was revised to become the 1611 King James Bible, and how the King James version slowly replaced the much more popular Geneva Bible among early American Colonists.\n\n“The Forbidden Book” is simply the most captivating and informative video ever produced on the subject of how we got the Bible, and how God has preserved His Word for thousands of years to countless generations.\n\nDirector: Brian Barkley\nWriter: Craig Lampe\nStarring: Craig Lampe, Jim Birdsall"

        "description": "THE WAR WITHIN is a unique fantasy that takes viewers to a world that only God can see; the world of the inner man. Michael Sinclair (Brett Varvel) is a syndicated cartoonist whose dream of a perfect life is upended when tragic events transform his dream into a nightmare. The result is a war that wages within his soul which is personified by six members; Mind, Memory, Emotion, Will, Conscience, and Heart. The ensuing battle for control adversely effects his relationship with his wife Amy (Rebecca Reid) and causes Michael to doubt his faith in God. But in the midst of this spiritual test, Michael discovers that victory is found in surrender. As viewers follow the quest for answers inside of Michael, they may discover their own war within.\n\nDirectors: Brett Varvel, Drew Varvel\nWriters: Brett Varvel, Gary Varvel \nCast: Brett Varvel, Rebecca Reid\n\nOther movies recommended on our Christian Movies YouTube channel:\nPower of the Air - https://youtu.be/sjEWbpGvswo\nA Dave Christiano Film",

        "description": "Alex, a lonely and broken man who has walked away from his Christian faith, is unable to breakaway from his past. A past filled with guilt for abandoning his parents when they needed him the most. Suffering from a heart disorder, Alex is in major debt from medical bills and is trying to make something of his life. He allows himself to be manipulated by his own friend Daniel, who suffers from a gambling addiction. Daniel always seems to pull Alex into his illegal get-rich-quick schemes. One of these schemes involves the two of them posing as missionaries and swindling churches out of thousands of dollars. Alex finds himself living the good life, debt free and financially secure, but still empty inside and lonely.

          "description": "Alex, a lonely and broken man who has walked away from his Christian faith, is unable to breakaway from his past. A past filled with guilt for abandoning his parents when they needed him the most. Suffering from a heart disorder, Alex is in major debt from medical bills and is trying to make something of his life. He allows himself to be manipulated by his own friend Daniel, who suffers from a gambling addiction. Daniel always seems to pull Alex into his illegal get-rich-quick schemes. One of these schemes involves the two of them posing as missionaries and swindling churches out of thousands of dollars. Alex finds himself living the good life, debt free and financially secure, but still empty inside and lonely. At one of the churches Alex is scamming, he meets Elaine, a sincere Christian woman, and they fall in love. Living a double life and with the FBI closing in on him, Alex will be faced with a choice that could cause him to lose the woman he loves and betray the only friend he has. Jacob, a wise Christian man, comes into Alex s life and offers him a second choice...a choice to lose his life in order to gain a new one.\n\nDirectors: Sandon Yahn, Isaac Meeks\nWriters: Isaac Meeks, Isaac Meeks\nCast: Crister De Leon, Melissa Dixon, David Morales, Joe Lambert\n\nOther movies recommended on our Christian Movies YouTube channel:\nPower of the Air - https://youtu.be/sjEWbpGvswo\nA Dave Christiano Film"

        "description": "A Youth Pastor (Sean Astin) and his wife (Erin Bethea) take 5 teens on a weekend camping trip. A conflict results between two of them and creates tension in the camp. To try and resolve this, the Youth Pastor tells the teens the story of the Old Testament prophet, Hosea. At first the teens don't want to hear it, but as he proceeds with the story, they become more interested. The story flashes back to Israel and shows Hosea's great commitment to God and unconditional love for his wife. This movie offers real inspiration through the character of Hosea and also has a touching gospel presentation showing the great love of Christ.\n\nDirector: Kevin Downes\nWriters: Greg Mitchell, Rich Christiano, Dave Christiano\nCast: Sean Astin, Erin Bethea, Elijah Alexander, Patty Duke\n\nDVD & Digital for AMAZING LOVE is available at ChristianFilms.com\n\nCheck out the entire Play list of films by Dave and Rich Christiano\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCooE0PxnbwbcPecHL5sy-NUL8zRkCUgC\n\n#fullmovie #movie #faith #drama #bible #christian #hosea #biblestories #biblestory",

Burned by an industry that wanted to change him, he chose a simpler life, living with his wife and daughter while playing the occasional song at a coffee house.

Exposing her identity to the killer, she leaps from her hiding place and into her car, careening out of the parking garage as shots ring out behind her.\nThe killer, Nahanee (Hrothgar Mathews — ‘Nuremberg’), is a famous crime boss who District Attorney Cloninger (Jerry Wasserman — ‘Smallville’) has been trying to convict for years. Now, Carol must uproot her two teenaged kids and join the Witness Protection Program. They were once a typical, modern family with their biggest worries revolving around basketball games and dates; now, their entire existence is focused on one thing—staying alive.",

In desperation, they turn to James Dolan who charges recipients exorbitant fees, while harvesting organs from needy donors like Maria - a terrified Mexican teenager, who’ll give up a kidney to help her family get across the border. Allie catches a glimpse of Maria in the makeshift operating room they share inside a downtown hotel. And while Allie’s transplant is successful, she can’t stop thinking about the young woman who saved her life. But when the desperate young donor dies during the botched surgery, Allie’s heroic fight for justice is the only way she can repay her, even if that means jeopardizing her own family’s future.",

        "description": "Starring: Michelle Morgan, Tim Reid & Stephen Huszar\n\nDefense attorney Sarah Wright doesn’t know why her reclusive neighbor, Mr. Landis, places a lit Christmas tree on the roof every year, but he has hauled it up there for as long as anyone can remember. And every year, this violation of the town’s penal code lands him in Judge Conner’s courtroom and puts him at risk for jail time. Yet for all the difficulty it causes him, Mr. Landis refuses to reveal why he does the same thing, every year, without fail.\n\nFinally, Sarah and Judge Conner take matters into their own hands. With only a few days until Christmas, Sarah agrees to represent Mr. Landis. The Judge imposes the task of rectifying the Landis case for good, insisting that the handsome but irritating prosecutor, John Keaton, help Sarah. Forced to pool their resources together, the young attorneys must set differences aside and eventually discover that the mystery is more personal and heartbreaking than anyone could suspect.",

          "description": "Starring: Michelle Morgan, Tim Reid & Stephen Huszar\n\nDefense attorney Sarah Wright doesn’t know why her reclusive neighbor, Mr. Landis, places a lit Christmas tree on the roof every year, but he has hauled it up there for as long as anyone can remember. And every year, this violation of the town’s penal code lands him in Judge Conner’s courtroom and puts him at risk for jail time. Yet for all the difficulty it causes him, Mr. Landis refuses to reveal why he does the same thing, every year, without fail.\n\nFinally, Sarah and Judge Conner take matters into their own hands. With only a few days until Christmas, Sarah agrees to represent Mr. Landis. The Judge imposes the task of rectifying the Landis case for good, insisting that the handsome but irritating prosecutor, John Keaton, help Sarah. Forced to pool their resources together, the young attorneys must set differences aside and eventually discover that the mystery is more personal and heartbreaking than anyone could suspect."

        "description": "After a PTSD—triggered military discharge, Todd Craig inherits a decrepit house on Calber Island, which has been resistant to change and suffers economically. When a storm destroys the bridge to the mainland, leaving Todd stranded with the untrusting locals, strange occurrences begin to unfold, revealing a Viking presence and the discovery of two girls hiding, unfamiliar with modern society. As tensions mount, Todd must now prepare for a Viking threat, navigate local hostility, and confront the possibility of losing their way of life—a suspenseful journey of blending historical elements with themes of change and unity.\nDirector: Jacob Johnston\nCast: Brooks Ryan, Trinity Piva, Sullivan David, Adam Chaffin, John Unkefer, Matthew Bowers, Brian Balance\n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3aOfZft\n\n► About \nEncourageTV brings you the best selection of FREE Family-Friendly, Kid-Friendly, Faith-Friendly and Christian content available anywhere!

          "description": "After a PTSD—triggered military discharge, Todd Craig inherits a decrepit house on Calber Island, which has been resistant to change and suffers economically. When a storm destroys the bridge to the mainland, leaving Todd stranded with the untrusting locals, strange occurrences begin to unfold, revealing a Viking presence and the discovery of two girls hiding, unfamiliar with modern society. As tensions mount, Todd must now prepare for a Viking threat, navigate local hostility, and confront the possibility of losing their way of life—a suspenseful journey of blending historical elements with themes of change and unity.\nDirector: Jacob Johnston\nCast: Brooks Ryan, Trinity Piva, Sullivan David, Adam Chaffin, John Unkefer, Matthew Bowers, Brian Balance\n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3aOfZft\n\n► About \nEncourageTV brings you the best selection of FREE Family-Friendly, Kid-Friendly, Faith-Friendly and Christian content available anywhere!

        "description": "Based on the novel by best-selling, author Robert Whitlow, JIMMY is a story about a mentally challenged boy who views the world through his own unique lens. Through the course of life-changing events during one Fall season, Jimmy’s family and those around him come to fully realize his impact on their community. Jimmy’s world is a place where a boy can grow to be a man, even if he is “special”. Where angels hover, mostly unseen. Where danger can happen, and hearts can falter – but love is never wasted. Jimmy knows he’s different from the other teenagers in Piney Grove, Georgia. He doesn’t always understand what he sees and hears, but he remembers it all with uncanny accuracy, which is why his lawyer father asks him to testify in a crucial trial. Jimmy’s testimony saves the man from jail but has far-reaching consequences for himself and the people he loves. Filled with Southern characters at once familiar and unexpected, Jimmy is an extraordinary tale about growing up in the midst of real struggle.\n\nDirected by Mark Freiburger\nStarring Ted Levine, Kelly Carlson, Patrick Fabian \n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3aOfZft\n\n► About \nEncourageTV brings you the best selection of FREE Family-Friendly, Kid-Friendly, Faith-Friendly and Christian content available anywhere!

Jimmy’s world is a place where a boy can grow to be a man, even if he is “special”. Where angels hover, mostly unseen. Where danger can happen, and hearts can falter – but love is never wasted. Jimmy knows he’s different from the other teenagers in Piney Grove, Georgia. He doesn’t always understand what he sees and hears, but he remembers it all with uncanny accuracy, which is why his lawyer father asks him to testify in a crucial trial. Jimmy’s testimony saves the man from jail but has far-reaching consequences for himself and the people he loves. Filled with Southern characters at once familiar and unexpected, Jimmy is an extraordinary tale about growing up in the midst of real struggle.\n\nDirected by Mark Freiburger\nStarring Ted Levine, Kelly Carlson, Patrick Fabian \n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3aOfZft\n\n► About \nEncourageTV brings you the best selection of FREE Family-Friendly, Kid-Friendly, Faith-Friendly and Christian content available anywhere!

        "description": "(Black Cinema, Faith, Drama)\nA Christian college student seeks answers about faith, family and life from her atheist professor.\n\nJoy Hunter has just graduated high school and has been accepted to a college with her two best friends. Joy is a Christian and has had her share of trials in life. Namely a disease that should have ended her life by age 15 is now in remission. Joy signs up for an Ancient History class taught by Professor Jim Byrnes. He is a sworn atheist, once a believer and does everything in his power to make students of faith, any faith very uncomfortable. Also joining the class is Paul Agard (mid-30s). Paul is back to school after many years to get his teaching degree. Paul finds out quickly that Professor Byrnes is not playing by the rules and doesn't hesitate to go head to head with him in front of the whole class. Joy begins to buy into the new teachings and ideas that Byrnes delivers and soon become a close follower. But Joy's home life begins to suffer as she and her parents begin to argue constantly about the college and her professor. Joy's health begins to fail. Her Pastor and doctor are very concerned. While talking with Byrnes on the college lawn, Joy passes out and is rushed to the hospital. She refuses to see her parents but wants to see Jim Byrnes. These two unlikely friends will soon see God in a way they had never expected. The Mis-Education of Joy is story based on true events seen and experienced through the eyes of Paul C. Agard of Queens New York.\n\nDirector: Glenn Bertelsen\nWriters: Paul C. Agard, Glenn Bertelsen\nStars: Michael Higgenbottom, Jessica Reed, Tom Pantera",

        "description": "A young, reserved war veteran risks his marriage and new ministry job by opposing a neighbourhood abortion clinic that has moved in across the street from his building.\n\nJesse Dean is a recently discharged soldier who had a rough upbringing, but found God because of his wife and is now totally devoted to his faith. He and his wife move to Philadelphia so he can take a new job as an outreach leader at an old church whose membership has been declining. Just as he starts connecting with the community, he discovers that directly across the street from the church is an abortion clinic. He goes to the pastor and several others in the church trying to get their help--to no avail. One day he's going around his everyday routine when a personal tragedy strikes; this brings him to the point that he starts to take action himself, but the more involved he gets, the more resistance he gets from those in the church and community, and from his wife, who thinks his actions will get him fired or jailed. Finally he must make a choice: take the easy way out and back off, like everyone wants him to do; or face a major confrontation that will require him to put everything on the line--his job, his marriage, and his freedom? This film encourages people to stand up for what they know is right, particularly as it pertains to taking God's truths into society to address social issues. It addresses the spirit of retreat as it pertains to engaging the culture that has developed within the Church.\n\nDirector: Pat Necerato\nWriter: Pat Necerato\nStars: James Russo, Paul Rodriguez, Rusty Joiner, Jocelyn Cruz, Victoria Gates, Christopher Mann",

In a unique casting, deaf and hearing actors work together and deliver a film which is authentic, charming, competitive, and challenging. Spirit of Love is a diverse coming of age story. A group of misfit teens arrive at the 33rd annual basketball camp, which is the first year girls will attend the camp. Some come with hoop dreams, while others are trying to survive tumultuous teenage angst. Alexi arrives angry and at odds with his Dad, Coach Phil, while Ford wants everyone to know he is more than Deaf, and Maddie thinks everyone sees her as a freak. Not only do they learn life lessons through the game of basketball, but they also soon learn what it means to soar like Eagles, win or lose. Spirit of Love will motivate, encourage, uplift, and inspire all audiences and leave you cheering.\n\nDirected by Darla Rae\nStarring Mike \"Stinger\" Glenn, Ketrick \"Jazz\" Copeland, Darla Rae",

The setting is Persia in the fourth century B.C., as Esther comes to the attention of the recently widowed King Ahasuerus. The King has been trying to stifle and defeat the campaign of hatred fomented against the Jews by his evil minister Haman (Sergio Fantoni). Before the King can pair off with Esther and defeat the villainous Haman, there are several intervening adventures and an additional, attractive woman who competes for attention. \n\nDirected by Raoul Walsh, Mario Bava \nStarring Joan Collins, Richard Egan, Denis O'Dea"

The funny, yet touching story of one band's efforts in a small town church.

Led by church treasurer Wayne Wilson, the congregation resist the idea of change and this new style of worship.

        "description": "Based on the award-winning novel by Rusty Whitener, Season of Miracles follows the Robins, an underdog Little League team through their 1974 season with newcomer and autistic baseball savant, Rafer (Grayson Russell, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Talladega Nights). Team leader Zack (Andrew Wilson Williams) takes Rafer under his wing despite taunting from their rivals, the Hawks. Their Coach (John Schneider, The Dukes of Hazzard, October Baby), manager Rebecca (Sydney Morgan Layne), and the rest of the Robins encourage Rafer as the team rises towards an unlikely championship season, that is less about winning and losing and more about living and dying. Season of Miracles is a life-inspiring story about sportsmanship, friendship, and courage in the face of adversity.\n\nDirectors: Dave Moody, Josh Moody\nWriter: Rusty Whitener\nCast: John Schneider, Grayson Russell, Andrew Wilson Williams, Sydney Morgan Layne\n\nOther movies recommended on our Christian Movies YouTube channel:\nPower of the Air - https://youtu.be/sjEWbpGvswo\nA Dave Christiano Film",

          "description": "Based on the award-winning novel by Rusty Whitener, Season of Miracles follows the Robins, an underdog Little League team through their 1974 season with newcomer and autistic baseball savant, Rafer (Grayson Russell, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Talladega Nights). Team leader Zack (Andrew Wilson Williams) takes Rafer under his wing despite taunting from their rivals, the Hawks. Their Coach (John Schneider, The Dukes of Hazzard, October Baby), manager Rebecca (Sydney Morgan Layne), and the rest of the Robins encourage Rafer as the team rises towards an unlikely championship season, that is less about winning and losing and more about living and dying. Season of Miracles is a life-inspiring story about sportsmanship, friendship, and courage in the face of adversity.\n\nDirectors: Dave Moody, Josh Moody\nWriter: Rusty Whitener\nCast: John Schneider, Grayson Russell, Andrew Wilson Williams, Sydney Morgan Layne\n\nOther movies recommended on our Christian Movies YouTube channel:\nPower of the Air - https://youtu.be/sjEWbpGvswo\nA Dave Christiano Film"

Anxious government leaders see a new movement rising called Christianity. Fearing their hold on the people is being threatened, they set out to stop the followers of Jesus Christ. Their plan is simple: prove that Jesus never rose from the dead and you put an end to Christianity. So, they put the resurrection on trial. You be the jury and examine the evidence. Hear the testimony of eyewitnesses. At the end of the film, you decide the verdict. Did Jesus really rise from the dead?.",

          "description": "Resurrection Trial (2009) | Full Movie | Robert Pierce | Tony Monaco | Jerry Houser | Barry Zoeller\n\nThis interesting drama portrays the events that followed the death and resurrection of Jesus as if they happened in modern times. Anxious government leaders see a new movement rising called Christianity. Fearing their hold on the people is being threatened, they set out to stop the followers of Jesus Christ. Their plan is simple: prove that Jesus never rose from the dead and you put an end to Christianity. So, they put the resurrection on trial. You be the jury and examine the evidence. Hear the testimony of eyewitnesses. At the end of the film, you decide the verdict. Did Jesus really rise from the dead?."

Although nine-year-old Ociee loves roaming Mississippi’s 1898 rural landscape, her widower father (Keith Carradine) feels that Ociee lacks a role model to help her become a “young lady.” So, Ociee boards a train to North Carolina, to be raised by her Aunt Mamie (Mare Winningham). Although Ociee meets heroes like the Wright Brothers and the U.S. President, she ultimately proves that she, too, is capable of greatness in this heartwarming, rewarding film the whole family will enjoy.\n\nDirected by Kristen McGary\nWritten and Produced by Amy McGary, Kristen McGary\nStarring Keith Carradine, Mare Winningham, Skyler Day, Ty Pennington, Lucas Till",

        "description": "Starring: Cheryl Ladd & Barry Bostwick\nPete Murphy’s life has changed since his separation from his wife, Sarah. He has a new fiancée, a new home in the tropics, and plans to start a new family. However, before any of this can happen, Pete must first finalise his divorce.\nWhen he asks Sarah to sign the papers that will put an end to their marriage, she agrees, but on one condition—Pete must first reconcile with his two daughters. In an attempt to patch things up and move on with his life, Pete returns home during the holidays while his fiancée heads to the Caribbean. As he re-enters the lives of the family he left behind, Pete begins to realise his life isn’t the only one that has changed. His wife is dating his former best friend, and his youngest daughter is pregnant--she’s a surrogate mother for her infertile sister’s baby.\nWhile spending the holidays with his wife and daughters, old feelings are rekindled. Pete finds himself torn between his new enticing life and the warmth of his family. Sometimes you don’t know what you have until it’s almost gone.",

Estuvieron a punto de casarse cuando tenían veintitantos años, pero Evelyn se echó atrás. Más tarde, Evelyn se casó con uno de los amigos divorciados de Jonathan, Thomas, y abandonó su fe católica en lugar de esperar a que él obtuviera la anulación.

Cuando Evelyn se acerca a Jonathan insistiendo en que intenten detener el matrimonio de sus hijos, emergen los verdaderos sentimientos de Evelyn y Jonathan el uno por el otro. ¿Evelyn volverá a la fe y se casará con Jonathan, o permanecerá distanciada?\n\nDirector: Marc Leif\nEscritor: Michael C.

But what is being practiced in today’s Christian church is far from what is biblical truth. On the contrary, these are some of the doctrines of demons that the bible warned us about (1 Tim. 4:1). Today’s Christian church has been infiltrated by many false prophets and false apostles that have completely ignored the God given qualifications for ministry (1 Tim. 2, 3), and have gone into ministry with the intent to further deceive for their own financial gain (2 Pet. 2:3).

        "description": "The stakes are much higher than life or death in The Tribunal, a courtroom drama set in a Catholic Marriage Tribunal. On the surface, it appears that the struggle between Tony and Joe, two best friends who both love Emily, hinges on Joe obtaining an annulment of his first marriage, so Emily, a devout Catholic, can marry him. Only Tony can testify to the truth and make the annulment a reality for Joe, but Tony still loves Emily, his ex-girlfriend. In reality, the struggle is for the souls of all three. Tony has been trying to come back to God because he wants Emily, and his heart tells him he has to be the best man he can be for her. Joe doesn't run as spiritually or emotionally deep as Tony, but he loves Emily, too, and he wants to do the right thing. Both Tony and Joe have to decide if they will make the sacrifice necessary to love Emily. She, in turn, must decide whether she truly loves Joe, or Tony. As they each fight for whom they love, the Tribunal slowly answers the ever-present question hanging over the proceedings, \"What does God want?\" Why it matters to these three is the reason it matters to every person. Our souls will not rest until they rest in the arms of the Lord.\n\nDirector: Marc Leif\nWriter: Michael C. Mergler\nStars: Ryan Wesley Gilreath, Chris Petty, Laura E.

          "description": "The stakes are much higher than life or death in The Tribunal, a courtroom drama set in a Catholic Marriage Tribunal. On the surface, it appears that the struggle between Tony and Joe, two best friends who both love Emily, hinges on Joe obtaining an annulment of his first marriage, so Emily, a devout Catholic, can marry him. Only Tony can testify to the truth and make the annulment a reality for Joe, but Tony still loves Emily, his ex-girlfriend. In reality, the struggle is for the souls of all three. Tony has been trying to come back to God because he wants Emily, and his heart tells him he has to be the best man he can be for her. Joe doesn't run as spiritually or emotionally deep as Tony, but he loves Emily, too, and he wants to do the right thing. Both Tony and Joe have to decide if they will make the sacrifice necessary to love Emily. She, in turn, must decide whether she truly loves Joe, or Tony. As they each fight for whom they love, the Tribunal slowly answers the ever-present question hanging over the proceedings, \"What does God want?\" Why it matters to these three is the reason it matters to every person. Our souls will not rest until they rest in the arms of the Lord.\n\nDirector: Marc Leif\nWriter: Michael C. Mergler\nStars: Ryan Wesley Gilreath, Chris Petty, Laura E.

Using excerpts from the 2010 dramatic film Wesley by John Jackman plus interviews with experts and on-location footage shot in Wesley’s England, this program takes you inside the world of this influential Christian leader.\n\nFew people have influenced the course of the church like John Wesley. Like his reforming predecessor, Martin Luther, Wesley’s early life was marked by a moralism driven by fear of God’s judgment. And it was Luther’s writing that helped Wesley to understand the scriptural message of grace through faith.  Set free from his bondage to self-righteousness Wesley set out to awaken a church that had once again traded the truth for lies and mission for self-preservation. This documentary uses excerpts from the award-winning 2010 dramatic film, Wesley along with expert commentary and footage shot in Wesley’s England.

It is a heart-warming account of the Easter story as seen through the eyes of a lovable pig (Horace), a faint-hearted horse (Monty), a pedantic rat (Slink), a rambling rooster (Drake), a motherly cow (Esmay) and a downtrodden donkey (Jack). This magnificent period piece with its epic sets is a roller coaster ride of emotions. Enveloped in humor, this quest follows the animals from the stable in Bethlehem to the great temple in Jerusalem and onto the hillside of Calvary as these unlikely heroes try to save their friend. The journey weaves seamlessly through the biblical accounts of Palm Sunday, Jesus turning the tables in the temple, Peter's denial and with a tense, heart-wrenching climax, depicts the crucifixion and resurrection with gentleness and breathtaking beauty. For Judah, the lamb with the heart of a lion, it is a story of courage and faith. For Jack, the disappointed donkey, it becomes a pivotal voyage of hope. For Horace, the, well the dirty pig, and Drake the ignorant rooster, it is an opportunity to do something inappropriate and get into trouble.\n\nDirectors: Deryck Broom, Roger Hawkins (co-director)\nWriters: Brent Dawes, Edward James\nCast: Ernest Borgnine, Anupam Kher, Sandi Patty\n\nOther movies recommended on our Christian Movies YouTube channel:\nPower of the Air - https://youtu.be/sjEWbpGvswo\nA Dave Christiano Film",

        "description": "This is a delightful redemption-themed family movie that will appeal to children, teens, horse-lovers and people of all ages. A Faith Based Movie about a Horse, a troubled son, his unforgiving grandfather, his distressed mother, 3 neighbor children, a bully and her father. After his mother unexpectedly dies, 17-year-old Ethan discovers he is the owner of his mother's horse - a horse he never even knew existed. He travels cross country to live with his grandparents and investigate the mystery. His grandmother is supportive but his angry grandfather Otto doesn't seem to want him around. Next door live three children who are taking riding lessons at the same farm where his mother's horse is boarded. Their lives intersect as Ethan deals with his grief over his mother's death and the children deal with a neighborhood bully whose father works at the horse farm. The journey for Ethan, Otto, the three children, the bully and her father all revolve around a gentle and faithful horse called Bear who deeply touches all their lives.\n\nDirector: Daniel Knudsen\nWriter: Penny Carlisi\nCast: Nicholas Ryan Gibbs, Wayne E.

As the trials on the trails begin to unfold, each member of the group starts to see their own strengths...and weaknesses. Each, that is, except Trevor.\n\nDirector: Bruce Lood\nWriter: Dennis Shippy \nActors: Scott Wallace, Lynn Baron, Bill Myers"

        "description": "Fathers is the story of two single fathers and their sons. One of the men, Rick Tarinno, lost his wife in a tragic car accident 3 years ago. Ever since the accident, Rick has blamed God for everything, from the death of his wife to the living hell that his life has turned into. He turned to a life of abuse and drinking to try to drown his sorrows. The other man, Michael Campbell, is approaching the three-year anniversary of the abandonment of his wife and subsequent divorce. The night she left was the same night as Rick's accident. Mike is a blue-collar guy that really had to learn to be a parent after the divorce. He turned to his church family and friends for support and help and they led him to God, his ultimate helper. Rick's son, Lucas, and Michael's son, Raymond, have known each other most of their lives. Since the death of Lucas' mom, things haven't really been the same. Lucas has been the victim of his fathers' abuse and has turned to a new group of friends for the attention that he isn't getting at home. Raymond, the star quarterback on the high school football team, has been trying to maintain their friendship, but can do nothing but watch as his lifelong friend slips lower and lower.   Rick's lack of faith, Michael's commitment to God, and Raymond's longing for his old friend will all be put to the test when Lucas is put in the toughest situation of his young life and Raymond is forced to fight for his. Only then will the truth be sought and hopefully found, before it's too late. \"Fathers\" is a touching look into the spiritual journey of four men searching for their place in the world.\n\nWritten and Directed by Chip Rossetti\nStarring Seth Adair, Mark Clem, Clay Evans",
