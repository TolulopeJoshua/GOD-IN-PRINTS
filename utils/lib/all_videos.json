An abandoned water truck was found in the Thai countryside containing more than 100 trafficked migrants; some 50 died while others disappeared. His investigation centers on The Pearl, a popular destination for sex tourists, and the place where Jason poses as a john so he can secretly meet with women and girls forced to work as prostitutes. Certain a young girl known only as Number 18 can be a key witness for his case, Jason must convince 18 to testify against her cut throat pimp. As Jason starts to build a relationship with 18, he sees in her reflections of the young daughters he has left far away at home in the USA. The riddle to solve the secrets of the abandoned water truck gets more complicated for Jason and his boss Marta when they come under increasing pressure from power brokers in Washington DC who are finalizing a key Asian trade deal. When his investigation starts to unravel, Jason realizes that rather than save 18 from her horrific circumstances he has put her life at risk. With a crime syndicate now chasing him down and no resources but his own wits, Jason must try to rescue 18 in the crowded city before the pimp moves her, for good.\n\nDirected by Matthew Kooman, Daniel Kooman\nStarring Giovanni Mocibob, Will Yun Lee, Eugenia Yuan, Teresa Ting, Gil Bellows\n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3aOfZft\n\n► About \nEncourageTV brings you the best selection of FREE Family-Friendly, Kid-Friendly, Faith-Friendly and Christian content available anywhere!

Frederick Douglass, No Turning Back is set in 1872, Ohio, where Frederick Douglass is on a national tour. The pastor (Clarence Felder) introduces him to his integrated church. Douglass then gives an electrifying sermon on his breathtaking journey from slavery to author, newspaper editor, and leading American statesmen.  One of our greatest heroes, Douglass had many triumphs, including helping pass Amendments to the US Constitution. He reveals his life in the North, in London, and as a Christian leader, with wit and wisdom. He could have lived in Europe but felt God's call to return to America to win freedom for all.

Frederick Douglass, No Turning Back is set in 1872, Ohio, where Frederick Douglass is on a national tour. The pastor (Clarence Felder) introduces him to his integrated church. Douglass then gives an electrifying sermon on his breathtaking journey from slavery to author, newspaper editor, and leading American statesmen.  One of our greatest heroes, Douglass had many triumphs, including helping pass Amendments to the US Constitution. He reveals his life in the North, in London, and as a Christian leader, with wit and wisdom. He could have lived in Europe but felt God's call to return to America to win freedom for all. There was no turning back. \nDirected by Chris Weatherhead\nStarring Kyle Taylor, Clarence Felder\n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3aOfZft\n\n► About \nEncourageTV brings you the best selection of FREE Family-Friendly, Kid-Friendly, Faith-Friendly and Christian content available anywhere!

This story narrows on the life of Kate Kensington who lost her fiancé, William, in that battle. Unable to bear the grief, Kate falls into a deep depression ending tragically with her taking her own life. Her body is never recovered. Reports are made of her apparition at the cemetery where William was buried and in the surrounding woods and the legend is born. The story then moves to the present day, where a clairvoyant young girl, Hayley Jennings, learns of the legend of Kate and begins having reoccurring vivid nightmares about her. Hayley begins seeing the silhouette of her, hearing her voice and through her dreams leans of a dark secret Kate's family kept from the public explaining why her spirit remains. Will Hayley be able to use her gift to help Kate, or is this secret so dark that uncovering it is too dangerous? Terrified, Hayley looks to God for strength.\n\nDirected by Bradley Castillo\nStarring Hayley Castillo, Melony Daemer, David McDivitt\n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3aOfZft\n\n► About \nEncourageTV brings you the best selection of FREE Family-Friendly, Kid-Friendly, Faith-Friendly and Christian content available anywhere!

When a devastating tragedy strikes, Luke is forced to take a hard look at his life and with the help of beautiful \"church-girl\" Emily and his Youth Pastor , he learns that there's much more to life than riding waves.\n\nDirectors: Lance Bachelder, Johnny Remo\nWriters: Lance Bachelder, Daniel Backman, (story) Johnny Remo (story)\nStars: Justin Schwan, Kelsey Sanders, Raquel Gardner, Angel Cruz, Greg Carlson, Andy Shephard, Danny Smith\n\n► Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3FU1Yeu\n\n► About\nDeep C Digital is one of the largest and trusted independent movie and TV distributors in the United States, providing outstanding content for today’s digital consumers.

The last of the Cathar heretics found protection at the Castle of Montsegur. Here a dedicated group of about 100 defending knights, under the Leadership of Lord Raymond and his family, held a crusading army of over 10,000 mercenaries at bay for 9 months.

The last of the Cathar heretics found protection at the Castle of Montsegur. Here a dedicated group of about 100 defending knights, under the Leadership of Lord Raymond and his family, held a crusading army of over 10,000 mercenaries at bay for 9 months. To this day, many people believe that the Cathars were the guardians of a treasure of great significance, possibly even the Holy Grail.

On the surface, it appears that the struggle between Tony and Joe, two best friends who both love Emily, hinges on Joe obtaining an annulment of his first marriage, so Emily, a devout Catholic, can marry him. Only Tony can testify to the truth and make the annulment a reality for Joe, but Tony still loves Emily, his ex-girlfriend. In reality, the struggle is for the souls of all three. Tony has been trying to come back to God because he wants Emily, and his heart tells him he has to be the best man he can be for her. Joe doesn't run as spiritually or emotionally deep as Tony, but he loves Emily, too, and he wants to do the right thing. Both Tony and Joe have to decide if they will make the sacrifice necessary to love Emily. She, in turn, must decide whether she truly loves Joe, or Tony. As they each fight for whom they love, the Tribunal slowly answers the ever-present question hanging over the proceedings, \"What does God want?\" Why it matters to these three is the reason it matters to every person.

A Magi named Artaban (Martin Sheen) sees a sign in the heavens that he hopes will lead him and his faithful servant to the Messiah. Artaban takes with him three precious gifts to present to the Messiah. For 33 years Artaban pursues Jesus, only to miss Him at every turn.

Just as he starts connecting with the community, he discovers that directly across the street from the church is an abortion clinic. He goes to the pastor and several others in the church trying to get their help--to no avail. One day he's going around his everyday routine when a personal tragedy strikes; this brings him to the point that he starts to take action himself, but the more involved he gets, the more resistance he gets from those in the church and community, and from his wife, who thinks his actions will get him fired or jailed. Finally he must make a choice: take the easy way out and back off, like everyone wants him to do; or face a major confrontation that will require him to put everything on the line--his job, his marriage, and his freedom? This film encourages people to stand up for what they know is right, particularly as it pertains to taking God's truths into society to address social issues. It addresses the spirit of retreat as it pertains to engaging the culture that has developed within the Church.\n\nDirector: Pat Necerato\nWriter: Pat Necerato\nStars: James Russo, Paul Rodriguez, Rusty Joiner, Jocelyn Cruz, Victoria Gates, Christopher Mann","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W57ln4iQP1s/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W57ln4iQP1s/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W57ln4iQP1s/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W57ln4iQP1s/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W57ln4iQP1s/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Deep C Digital","tags":["Movies","Full Movies","Entertainment","Deep C Digital","Rusty Joiner","Jocelyn Cruz","Victoria Gates","Pat Necerato","Voiceless Movie","Voiceless Full Movie","Voiceless Full Film","Voiceless 2015 Movie","Voiceless 2015 Full Movie","Voiceless 2015 Full Film","drama movie","thriller movie","christian movie","religious movie"],"categoryId":"24","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en","localized":{"title":"Voiceless | Poignant Drama | James Russo | Paul Rodriguez | Rusty Joiner | Jocelyn Cruz","description":"A young, reserved war veteran risks his marriage and new ministry job by opposing a neighbourhood abortion clinic that has moved in across the street from his building.\n\nJesse Dean is a recently discharged soldier who had a rough upbringing, but found God because of his wife and is now totally devoted to his faith.
